# CPU Scheduling Simulation

This project is a rudimentary simulation of an operating system. The initial focus will be on processes, assumed to be resident in memory, waiting to use the CPU. Memory and the I/O subsystem are not covered in this project.

The four scheduling algorithms that are simulated in the project are:
* Shortest Job First (SJF)
* Shortest Remaining Time (SRT)
* First Come First Served (FCFS)
* Rount Robin (RR)
